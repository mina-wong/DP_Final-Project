The invention discloses a method of anti-friction coating formation from powder materials comprising preparation of bronze powder stock with addition of powders of fluxing materials, placing the stock on the surface of a part of a rotation body type followed by centrifugal forming, induction heating of the part to a temperature ensuring stock deposition, and isothermal holding. In accordance with the invention, before stock preparation, bronze powder is subjected to pre-conditioning, namely, heating to a temperature of 200-300°C followed by cooling at a rate of 0.3-0.5∙10deg/s, and in the course of preparation, the stock is mixed with nano-sized particles of refractory compounds by a mechanochemical method.

Said objective is attained by provision of current protection of a power transmission line against phase-to-phase short circuits comprising input current transducers having their inputs connected to measuring transformers of the protected transmission line current, and their outputs to inputs of a negative sequence current filter, a maxi-selector and a mini-selector; the mini-selector output is connected to the first input of a short-circuit type determining unit, its second input is connected to the output of the maxi-selector; connected to the maxi-selector are the second input of the second-stage measuring instrument with a setpoint adjustment unit, the input of the first-stage measuring instrument with a setpoint adjustment unit, the third input of the short-circuit zone determining unit with a parameter setting unit, and the fourth input of the time delay computation and control unit with a parameter setting unit.

The second protection stage according to the invention is made as responding to total currents of phases in case of symmetrical short circuits in a power transmission line, and as responding to negative sequence current in case of asymmetrical short circuits. As a result, the second protection stage in case of asymmetrical short circuits does not require shifting out of load modes but shifts out of misbalances of negative sequence filters and of negative sequence currents of admissible continuous asymmetry. This ensures significant reduction of the second protection stage actuation current value and leads to higher sensitivity of the second stage to asymmetrical short circuits.",BELARUSIAN NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIV (BY),ROMANYUK FEDOR ALEXEEVICH (BY); RUMYUANTSEV VLADIMIR YURIEVICH (BY); SHEVALDIN MIKHAIL ANDREEVICH (BY),H02H3/08,1,,0,EA201700190A,1,2018-09-28,2019-02-28,5,3,3,3,2,0,

If there are 0 points, there is a risk of fatal outcome 13.3 %, 1 point – 23.1 %, 2 points – 26.7 %, 3 points – 36.8 %, 4 points – 43.5 %, 5 points – 70.0 %, 6 points – 76.9 %, from 7 to 9 points – 81.3%.EFFECT: use of the invention makes it possible to determine Pat an early stage, promptly prescribe treatment and prevent a fatal outcome.1 cl, 5 tbl, 4 ex",GOSUDARSTVENNOE UCHREZHDENIE VYSSHEGO PROFESSIONALNOGO OBRAZOVANIYA BELORUSSKO ROSSIJSKIJ UNIV (BY),TOCHILO SERGEJ ANATOLEVICH (BY); MAROCHKOV ALEKSEJ VIKTOROVICH (BY); POZDNYAKOV VITALIJ FEDOROVICH (BY),G01N33/48,1,G01N33/48 (RU),1,RU2017114336A,1,2018-10-19,2018-10-19,0,5,5,5,6,2,

Essence: indenter of variable cross-section is continuously pressed with continuously increasing load to maximum value of arbitrary value, after which the impression is stopped and sample is unloaded to zero value. Magnitude of the load and the corresponding displacement depth of the indenter are recorded, and the pressure on the contact surface between the indenter and the sample is calculated in the period of increasing load. Indenting and unloading of the indenter is performed without changing its position in a cyclic manner, providing in each subsequent cycle a discrete increase in the maximum load value at which unloading begins. During sample unloading, pressure is determined on contact surface by ratio of load on indenter to maximum area of contact surface in each cycle. In each cycle, also for the same depth of the indenter displacement, the difference between the pressure on the contact surface during the load increase and the pressure during the unloading period is calculated, and the maximum value of the difference of the said pressures is determined. Tests are continued until formation of horizontal section on graph of relationship between maximum values of pressure difference and corresponding load values.

Both the luminescence of the transparent luminescent material and the signal of transient absorption are proportional to the population of the radiative level of a rare earth ion, thus the time evolution of transient absorption signal follows the time evolution of luminescence. The time resolution in the transient absorption measurements is limited just by the duration of laser pulses exploited and might be as short as 10 fs (in examples, we demonstrate 300 fs). Meanwhile, the time resolution of other techniques which are currently in use for measuring or estimating the luminescence kinetics, have physical limitations either due to the response time of photodetectors and other electronic devices or to a low efficiency in measurements with a high time resolution.

The input of the microwave amplifier is connected to the output of receiver antenna, and its output — to the input of transmittal antenna and to the input of frequency meter that measures the amplifier self-excitation frequency, and based on this value the suspension concentration is to be determined. A microwave key and a controllable phase shifter are connected in series and installed to the break of circuit between the amplifier output and the radiating antenna input; and the control input of the phase shifter is connected to the temperature sensor output. This automatically eliminates any need to switch off and on the device in case of air bubbles generation in the measuring channel and oscillation frequency jumping associated with it.",AQUAR SYSTEM LTD (BY),BELYACHITS ALEXANDER CHESLAVOVICH (BY); DESHENKO GENNADY NIKOLAEVICH (BY); LEBEDEV VALERY MIKHAILOVICH (BY); NIKITIN ALEXEY MSTISLAVOVICH (BY); TITOVITSKY IOSIF ANTONOVICH (BY),G01N22/00; G01N9/00; G01R27/32,3,G01N22/00 (EA); G01N27/32 (EA); G01N9/00 (EA),3,EA202000006A,1,2021-04-30,2022-02-03,10,3,3,3,3,0,

The aim of the present invention is to expand the existing range of methods and devices for improving the quality of an inhalable aerosol applicable to devices having a container for a liquid by additionally moistening (and, if necessary, flavouring) the inhalable aerosol, as well as by cleaning the walls of said container, by exposing the liquid to ultrasonic radiation. This aim is solved in a method for improving the quality of an inhalable aerosol, which consists in creating a mixture of water and particles of an active substance; passing the mixture of water and particles of an active substance through a layer of at least one liquid situated in a container to form an inhalable aerosol; accumulating the inhalable aerosol above the surface of said liquid; and inhaling the aerosol, in that the at least one liquid situated in said container is exposed to ultrasonic radiation.
