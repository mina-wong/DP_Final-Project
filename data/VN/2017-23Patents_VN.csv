The padded member is made of resilient materials. The padded member's shape is roughly similar to that of a rectangular or hexagonal block; however, if looked right from its right or left side, the padded member has a symmetric or a symmetric bell shape. The length of the long side of the padded member is roughly equal to an adult's body's width. The hard block is made of non resilient material. The hard block is able to tolerate, without rupturing and/or deformation, the gravity force on a mass of about 140 kg with a shape and size similar to those of a person's body. The shape of the hard block and of the padded member are similar, and their dimensions are proportional. The length of the long side of the hard block is also roughly equal to an adult's body's width. Both the padded member and the hard block have a flat bottom side. .4--4,-""3:021 2021 400 200, 201 FIG . 1 - 202",KIM THI PHAM LOAN (VN); KIM THI PHAM LOAN,KIM THI PHAM LOAN; KIM THI PHAM LOAN,A47C16/00; A47C20/00,2,"A47C16/00 (KR); A47C20/00 (KR); A47C20/027 (EP,US); A47G9/10 (US)",4,AU2012385226A; AU2016273948A; CA2901108A; CY211101081T; DK12756023T; EP12756023A; ES12756023T; HK15109173A; HRP20211928T; HUE12756023A; IB2012053508W; KR20157003442A; KR20187002760A; KR20197014450A; LT12053508T; PL12756023T; PT12756023T; SG11201500977VA; US201214421653A,16,2014-01-16,2022-11-25,106,0,0,0,0,0,

This art is therefore also designed to kill early female zygotes (XX) that may have survived the previous knockdown, and the all male progenies are created only when an antibiotic substance has been added into food and drink to feed mosquitoes. The strict limit of the antibiotic exposure time allows mosquito-adapted Wolbachia bacteria to survive. Selected Wolbachia bacteria may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) of up to 100%.

Also, people tend to use their mobile devices for accessing various services such as banking, shopping, E-Mail, ticket booking, chatting, listening to music, watching videos, etc. To get these services, the mobile devices have to get connected with anyone of the nearby Access Point or Base Station. If the currently connected base station is not able to provide services properly, then, the mobile device has to identify and connect the best base station concerning signal strength, required bandwidth, tolerable packet delay, etc., which is called as network selection process or handover. This handover process can be classified into two types horizontal handover and vertical handover. During handover if the old and new base station belongs to the same network standard then it is said to be a horizontal handover, else, if the old and new base station belongs to different network standards then it is said to be a vertical handover. During this handover process, few milliseconds of the break will happen to the ongoing services and this break in service is very minimum in horizontal handover when compared to the vertical handover. Moreover, the frequent handover process will degrade the performance of the ongoing services dramatically. In some situations, even after the handover process, the mobile may not get the service properly from the new base station due to various reasons which are called unbeneficial handover. In this invention, a handover method is proposed to minimize the number of unbeneficial handovers in WiMAX/WLAN integrated overlay networks by estimating the network condition and velocity of the mobile device before the handover process. Also in this invention, both the estimation of network condition and velocity of the mobile device are done using simple numerical methods without increasing much computational complexity to the mobile device. This invention proposes two handover algorithms for handling two different network scenarios in the form of pseudo-code which will improve the quality of service considerably by minimizing the number of unbeneficial handovers and by giving priority to the horizontal handover than the vertical handover.",CHURI PRATHAMESH MR (IN); DEMBRANI (IN); DEVI JYOTI MS (IN); DHIMAN GAURAV DR (IN); JAWARE TUSHAR HRISHIKESH DR (IN); NAYYAR ANAND DR (VN); S GOMATHI DR (IN); SONI MUKESH DR (IN),S  GOMATHI; SONI MUKESH; DEVI JYOTI; NAYYAR ANAND; JAWARE TUSHAR HRISHIKESH; DEMBRANI MAHESH BHIMSHAM; DHIMAN GAURAV; CHURI PRATHAMESH,H04W48/18,1,H04W36/00835 (AU); H04W36/08 (AU); H04W36/22 (AU); H04W36/32 (AU); H04W48/10 (AU); H04W48/18 (AU); H04W48/20 (AU); H04W84/042 (AU); H04W84/12 (AU),9,AU2020102358A,1,2020-11-05,2020-11-05,0,0,0,0,0,0,

The invention was implemented to identify the key points required to record the input picture of the reference model. The key points found in the picture were the identification of the agar plate, its compartments and its rotation. The drawings illustrates that the recording of an image with the proper key points was sufficient to match the image of agar plates to a reference model, despite all scale, position, perspective or rotation variations. However, the accuracy was dependent on understanding the characteristics of the agar plate.

However, the operation principle is totally different. In the machine of the invention, one quartz electronic circuit generates a pulse oscillation with a standard frequency of 1 Hz. This pulse maintains the oscillation of pendulum and creates energy for the machine of the clock to operate. The harmonic oscillation pendulum is changed into a constrained oscillation following the frequency of pulse, so that the degree of accuracy of the electronic clock can reach ± 10 seconds per year. Therefore, energy for the clock to operate is also the current for the electronic circuit, it is very small with an average of 5µA. A set of pendulum oscillation includes a pendulum bob of 10 kg, a pendulum rod hanging the pendulum bob, an electromagnet attached on the pendulum rod, a fixed electromagnetic coil, a ratchet wheel and a pawl to change energy from pendulum oscillation to become a moment to rotate the wheel system of the clock machine.
